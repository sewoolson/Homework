# Sam Woolson's Intro Speech and Resume

## Intro Speech
Hi everyone! My name is Sam Woolson.

I have a background in Graphic Design, Nursing, and UX/UI.  I possess an insatiable thirst for knowledge, particularly in full-stack web development, wireframing, prototyping, user research, 2D animation, and other areas. I have always enjoyed creating but find myself frustrated by not being able to implement and finish passion projects. Hence my interest in Savvy Coders. I realized this is exactly what I needed to accomplish my goal.

Drawing on my healthcare experience within nursing and digital marketing experience as well as societal needs I have decided to create a healthcare resource website and eventually an app for the transgender community. Something through research has proven is a necessity for this community.

Reddit for example has numerous subthreads for the trans community but constant endless searching to find information, same with other trans apps out there that are focused on scheduling appointments/therapy/hormone therapy and so forth. The problem is that none of these resources can be found in one spot and that’s what my capstone Transform Healthcare is meant to solve. All the resources necessary to find care but based on the community’s recommendations and reviews. After all life is hard but their healthcare journey shouldn’t be.

I accomplished this through my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript.

So without further ado let me show you what I’ve created!
